üå± Plant Disease Detection
Overview
This repository hosts the code for a Plant Disease Detection application, which utilizes a trained machine learning model to identify common diseases in plants from uploaded images. The goal is to provide a quick, accessible, and user-friendly tool for farmers, gardeners, and enthusiasts to diagnose plant health issues.

The project is built around a web application (likely using Streamlit or Flask as suggested by the files like app.py, Procfile, and setup.sh) that serves predictions from a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.

üöÄ Features
Image Upload: Easily upload images of plant leaves for analysis.

Disease Prediction: Get a real-time prediction of the plant's health status (e.g., healthy, or specific disease name).

Model Details: Information on the model's architecture and performance metrics.

Web Interface: A simple and intuitive web interface for interaction.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
Component	Technology/File	Purpose
Machine Learning	Plant Disease Detection.ipynb	Contains the Jupyter Notebook for data exploration, model training (likely a CNN), and evaluation.
Web Application	app.py	The main Python file containing the logic for the web application's frontend and backend.
Environment	requirements.txt	Lists all necessary Python packages and their versions (e.g., tensorflow, numpy, streamlit/flask, opencv).
Deployment	Procfile, setup.sh	Configuration files for cloud deployment platforms like Heroku or a similar service.
Utility Functions	utils.py	Houses reusable helper functions (e.g., image preprocessing, loading the trained model).

Export to Sheets
üìã Installation and Setup
Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x

Git

Steps
Clone the Repository:

Bash

git clone [Your Repository URL]
cd plant-disease-detection
Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Recommended):
A virtual environment keeps project dependencies isolated.

Bash

python -m venv venv
# For Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# For macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
Install Dependencies:
Install all the required libraries using the provided requirements.txt file.

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the Model Weights:

NOTE: The model weights (e.g., model.h5 or a similar file) are often too large for GitHub and are mentioned to be in "Drive." You must add a link or instructions here for users to download the trained Model 5 file.

Instruction Placeholder: Download Model 5 (H5 file) from [Link to Google Drive/External Storage] and place it in the root directory (or a designated models/ folder).

‚öôÔ∏è Running the Application
Assuming your application is built with Streamlit (common for ML demos) and the entry file is app.py:

Bash

streamlit run app.py
If your application uses Flask or another framework, the command might be:

Bash

python app.py
The application will typically open in your web browser at http://localhost:8501 (for Streamlit) or a similar address.

üß™ Model Training Details
Model Architecture: Briefly mention the type of model (e.g., Custom CNN, Transfer Learning with ResNet50, etc.).

Dataset Used: Specify the dataset (e.g., PlantVillage Dataset, custom collected data) and the number of classes/diseases.

Performance: Briefly state the key metric (e.g., Validation Accuracy: 97.5%).

For full details on the training process, please refer to the Plant Disease Detection.ipynb notebook.
